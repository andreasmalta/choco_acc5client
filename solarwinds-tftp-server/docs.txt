TFTP Server	
Introduction
Numerous network devices, including routers, switches, hubs, X-terminals, printers, and terminal server devices, need a TFTP server to load initial configuration, IOS files, and transfer configuration file updates. SolarWinds TFTP Server was written to transmit and receive multiple configuration files at the same time using multiple connections. 

Note: A TFTP Server is not an FTP server. TFTP and FTP are different protocols. You cannot connect to a TFTP server with an FTP client.

Installing and Running SolarWinds TFTP Server
You can modify the installation location and other settings using the SolarWinds TFTP Server setup program.

Note: The Windows user account used to install SolarWinds TFTP Server must have administrator rights.

To install SolarWinds TFTP Server:
Run the setup program (SolarWindsTftpServer.exe).
Complete the setup wizard, providing the appropriate information as necessary.
To run SolarWinds TFTP Server:
Start TFTP Server in the SolarWinds TFTP Server folder.

Configuring Your TFTP Server
The TFTP server runs as a service, but some basic configuration may be necessary to ensure the TFTP server behaves in a way that works best within your environment. Complete the following procedure to setup your server.

To configure your TFTP server:
Click File > Configure.
Click the General tab, and then specify whether to start the server.
If you want the TFTP server to appear in the task tray, check Add TFTP Server to Windows task tray.
Specify a directory to use as the root directory of the TFTP server. Files received by the TFTP server are saved here. Files to be sent by the TFTP server must be first copied to this directory.
Click the Security tab, and select what actions you want to allow the TFTP server to do. For example, click Receive Files if you want to restrict the server to only receiving files.
If you want to restrict TFTP server functions to a specific IP address range, click Add and then specify the beginning and ending IP addresses of the range. Then, click OK.
Click OK.
Note: TFTP protocol has no innate security. There are no passwords or authentication. SolarWinds TFTP Server adds security by allowing you to limit the server's functionality and specify a range of IP addresses from which to accept requests.
