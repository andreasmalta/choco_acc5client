By combining the two license files, you can run all the products on the\n            same network. Autodesk Account provides a way to generate a license file that automatically\n            consolidates network licenses. However, you may sometimes need to combine your network\n            licenses by manually adding license statements in the new file to the end of the existing\n            file. \n            	 \n         </p>\n         <p>You can safely combine the following: \n            	 \n         </p><a name=\"UL_E42B4D78DD284AAA952D7DED5534ACB6\"></a><ul>\n            <li> Licenses for different Autodesk products, regardless of the version. Example: Revit\n               and 3ds Max. \n               		\n            </li>\n            <li> Licenses for different versions of the same product. Example: Revit 2015 and Revit\n               2016. \n               		\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p> Do not attempt to combine the following: \n            	 \n         </p><a name=\"UL_2F954E58675B440E89AAB39410DEBC8D\"></a><ul>\n            <li> Multiple licenses for the same product and version, issued on different dates. For\n               example, suppose that you have 12 AutoCAD 2016 licenses and later purchase 8 more\n               licenses for the same product. In a combined file, the 8 later ones supersede all\n               the earlier ones, and you have access to only 8 licenses, not 20. \n               		\n            </li>\n            <li> License files for a package (multiple releases of a product) and for a product included\n               in the package. For example, suppose that you combine a new package license for Building\n               Design Suite 2013-2016 with an older single license for Revit 2015. In this case,\n               the Revit suite version supersedes and cancels the older Revit license. \n               		\n            </li>\n            <li>License files for two suites that have products in common and different issue dates.\n               For example, suppose that you combine license files for 2016 package versions of Building\n               Design Suite and Product Design Suite. In this case, you cancel the licenses in one\n               suite for products common to both suites. \n               		\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <div><a name=\"GUID-C31AA9B8-7BD4-410E-8874-CD9A5C8D3CFE\"></a><div class=\"note-note\"><span class=\"label label-target-language\">NOTE:</span> If you encounter problems with a complex combination scenario, contact Autodesk Support:\n               \n               		<a href=\"https://knowledge.autodesk.com/contactus\">https://knowledge.autodesk.com/contactus</a>. Instead of combining the licenses yourself, you can request a new license file that\n               includes all the licenses you want to combine. This new license file has a single\n               issue date for all product licenses, which prevents any of them from superseding earlier\n               licenses. \n               	 \n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div class=\"footer-block\"><a href=\"..\" class=\"comments-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"comments-link\">Please send us your comment about this page</span></a></div><br><p class=\"footer-license-block\"><a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width: 0;\" src=\"../images/ccLink.png\"></a>&nbsp;<em>Except where otherwise noted, this work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.
