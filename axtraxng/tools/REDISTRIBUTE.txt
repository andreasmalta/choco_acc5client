I was hoping to create a package for AxTraxNG, but I'm having trouble since your server does not have very fast upload and no ssl. So I was going to ask for permission to redistribute AxTraxNG from a faster server (either chocolatey.org or github.com), obviously without altering the software in any way. Would this be ok please?
